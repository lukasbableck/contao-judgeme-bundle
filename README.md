# Contao Judge.me Bundle

This bundle provides a simple integration of the Judge.me review system into Contao.
It does not use the JS script provided by Judge.me, but instead uses the API to fetch the reviews and display them in a custom way.
Because of that it also does not require the Awesome plan, but the free plan is sufficient.

## Compatibility

Contao 4.13 & 5.*

## Configuration

Set the Judge.me shop domain and API keys in the root page.


Create a content element of type "Judge.me Reviews" and select the product you want to display the reviews for.
